/*
 * There was no server-side logout endpoint anywhere in the app at
 * first. The "logout" buttons (site-shell.js, pages/common.js) only
 * removed unrelated localStorage keys ("token"/"user" - leftovers from
 * an older approach) and reloaded the page. The real session cookie
 * set by log_in/register/register_super_admin is httpOnly, which means
 * client-side JS can never read or delete it with document.cookie -
 * that's the whole point of httpOnly (XSS protection). Without a
 * dedicated endpoint that calls res.clearCookie() server-side, the
 * cookie never actually went away: after "logging out" and reloading,
 * /api/auth/me still validated the same token and the user was
 * immediately treated as signed in again.
 *
 * clearCookie's options (httpOnly/sameSite/secure/path) must match the
 * options used when the cookie was originally set for the browser to
 * actually remove it instead of silently ignoring the clear
 * instruction. Importing the same COOKIE_OPTIONS used by
 * log_in.controller.js / register.controller.js / register_super_admin.js
 * guarantees that instead of relying on every file to repeat the same
 * literal values correctly.
